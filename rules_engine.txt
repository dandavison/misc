* Definitions

** Rule
- A Rule is a database row.
- Its fields are partitioned into Value Fields and Rule Fields.
- In addition, a Rule has a collection of Predicates
- For example
| should_discard | expired | canceled |
|----------------|---------|----------|
|                |         |          |


** Predicate
A predicate specifies 3 things:
- The name of a rule field (rule lookup)
- The name of a joined database column
- The query logic for comparing the joined column value to the rule field value

** `get_Q_for_rule(predicate, rule) -> query`
This function applies a predicate to a rule.
